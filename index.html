			<p>The Masters Tournament is held annually at Augusta National, one of the most prestigous golf courses in the country. Augusta National's hallowed grounds have been walked by both past and present heroes of the sport. Golfers such as Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tiger Woods, and Phil Mickelson have experienced The Masters. Few have had the privilege of wearing the green jacket though, which serves as one of the tournament's trophies.</p>
